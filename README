## README for keybindings_exim-gs
 
* The keybindings_exim-gs package formalizes the installation of keybindings.pl,
     a perl script to export/import gsettings schemas for keybindings used in graphical Linux environments.

The actual perl code was probably written by
Stephen Ostermiller, and
thanks go to @elgalu for sharing the script on Github.

The keybindin.pl script is run with -e or -i 
to export or import respecively, gsettings for ones keybindings, whether vendor shipped or custom, to and from .csv files.

I am very happy to be able to type one command and have all my keyboard shortcuts ready to use as opposed to havinig to spend a half an hour or more 
recreating them with a graphical interface, and suspect others will as well.
I sincerely hope others find this useful as I have, and will share any suggestions for improvements.

This script also makes it easy to share ones configuration through out an organization or among friends, family or coworkers.
 
As usual I use the GNU-PL3, but wil entertain requests for shipping a version with the WTF license. You'll need to make a good case for the latter of 
course.
